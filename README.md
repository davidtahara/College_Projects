# College_Projects
Collection of some of my college projects i find interesting

Most of it will be college works/ homeworks/ exercises i received in class, with some of it being personal exercises i did while studying code,
be it for college, myself or for professional motives.

I believe all projects here will be of easy understanding, and, when needed, i will be adding extra descriptions/external items for help better understanding,
such as images/text(see calc.c + image for example).
